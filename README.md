# Hi there👋🏻  <br/>I'm Kerry, a UI Designer in Monstarlab, Inc.

### Work
So far, I have worked as a designer in graphic fields such as printing and CI. Since becoming a freelance a year and a half ago, I have expanded my work to the web and tried different technologies/tools. → React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, CSS module, etc...

> I'm good at component-oriented UI design and I love it. 

Currently, I am working as a Design Division / UI Designer in [Monstarlab, Inc.](https://monstar-lab.com/global/), a digital consulting firm in Tokyo.

### Starters
Recently I created some Gatsby starters. It's designed for my own use, but if you're looking for a cool starter at Gatsby, definitely use it.
