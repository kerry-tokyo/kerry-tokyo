Hi there, I'm Kerry, a graphic / web designer currently living in Tokyo.

### Work
Up to now, I have worked as a designer in the graphic areas such as printing and CI. Since becoming a freelance a year and a half ago, I've expanded my work to the web and tried out different technologies/tools. : React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, CSS modules and more...

## Present 
While working on graphic design, I am developing a web service using Next.js and Firebase with my acquaintance. It will be released by October of this year.

## Future 
After the service currently under development has been released, I will leave freelance and join a new team (company), so I plan to find a job change destination.
SONICJAM, SHIFTBRAIN, SIMONE is the company I want to belong to, but if you are interested in me at other companies, please contact me!
I look forward to working with you.
