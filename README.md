# Hi there👋🏻  <br/>I’m Kerry, a freelance UI/UX Designer.

### Work
I have accumulated extensive experience in the field of design, working on a variety of projects. After gaining experience as a graphic designer at an advertising agency, I joined A.C.O. Inc., where I worked as a UI designer. During my time there, I was involved in a wide range of tasks, including designing for websites and native apps, building design systems, and managing renewal projects.

After transitioning from A.C.O. to Monster Lab Inc., I continued to engage in similar design activities. Throughout my career, I have addressed various creative challenges and expanded my focus beyond UI design to include user experience. This included conducting user testing and interviews, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in UX-related fields. Currently, I work as a freelancer, collaborating with several companies.

Experienced with various technologies and tools in practice and personal development. → React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, CSS modules, etc.

> Done is better than perfect.

### Starters
Recently I created some Gatsby starters. It's designed for my own use, but if you're looking for a cool starter at Gatsby, definitely use it.
