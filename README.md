# Hi thereüëãüèª  <br/>I'm Kerry, a Graphic and Web designer currently living in Tokyo.

### Work
So far, I have worked as a designer in graphic fields such as printing and CI. Since becoming a freelance a year and a half ago, I have expanded my work to the web and tried different technologies/tools. ‚Üí React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, CSS module, etc...

> I'm good at component-oriented UI design and I love it. (That is React)

### Future
I am currently working as a freelancer, but I will leave freelance in the near future and belong to a web-based design company. There are several companies I would like to visit, but if you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me.

### Starters
Recently I created some Gatsby starters. It's designed for my own use, but if you're looking for a cool starter at Gatsby, definitely use it.
