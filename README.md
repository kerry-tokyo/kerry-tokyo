## üòò Hi there, I'm Kerry, a Graphic and Web designer currently living in Tokyo.

### Work
So far, I have worked as a designer in graphic fields such as printing and CI. Since becoming a freelance a year and a half ago, I have expanded my work to the web and tried different technologies/tools. ‚Üí React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, CSS module, etc...

I'm good at component-oriented UI design and I love it. (That is, React)

### Present 
I'm also developing a web service using Next.js and Firebase. It will be released by October of this year.

### Future 
After the service currently under development has been released, I will leave freelance and join a new team (company), so I plan to find a job change destination.
[SONICJAM](https://www.sonicjam.co.jp/), [SHIFTBRAIN](https://www.shiftbrain.com/), [SIMONE](https://ilovesimone.com/) is the company I want to belong to, but if you are interested in me at other companies, please contact me!
I look forward to working with you ü§ù
